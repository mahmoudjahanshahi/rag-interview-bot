As an Artificial Intelligence Analytics Architect, you will bring expert-level knowledge in support of sales motions and project execution across Avanade's Data & AI portfolio.

This role requires a deep understanding of AI/ML technologies, cloud platforms, and the ability to translate complex business requirements into scalable, production-ready solutions for our clients.  

What you’ll do 
- Architect Scalable AI Solutions: Design and optimize end-to-end ML and LLM systems—including traditional ML, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and agentic AI architectures—that serve real-time and batch workloads at enterprise scale. 
- Build and Operationalize Production Systems: Lead implementation of production-ready AI solutions using tools such as Azure ML, Databricks, and Azure AI Foundry, ensuring performance, reliability, security, and compliance.

Skills and experiences  
- AI & ML Architecture: Proven experience architecting end-to-end solutions across the ML and LLM lifecycle—from data ingestion and model training to inference, monitoring, and continuous improvement. 
- Strategic & Business Alignment: Ability to balance technical feasibility with business value, driving adoption of AI technologies that align with organizational priorities and customer needs. 
- Cloud & Data Ecosystems: Deep familiarity with Azure and with tools like Azure Functions, AKS, Event Hubs, Spark, for scalable, real-time architectures. 
- Programming & Tools Proficiency: Strong working knowledge in Programming/scripting languages, i.e., Python/Java, Scala, SQL, and experience across machine learning and deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow). 
- Deployment & MLOps: Understanding of modern MLOps practices, including containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), CI/CD pipelines, and observability tools. 
- LLMs and Agentic Systems: Experience building solutions using LLMs, with practical understanding of prompt engineering, semantic search, tool usage, and orchestrated multi-agent workflows. 
- Communication & Leadership: Ability to engage both technical and non-technical stakeholders, lead architecture reviews, and represent AI strategy in cross-functional conversations. 
- Continuous Learning: Strong curiosity and drive to stay current with the latest AI research, technologies, and tools—and apply that knowledge to build smarter, more effective solutions.
