# General Interview Tips

- Be concise, clear, and structured in all your answers.
- Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for behavioral questions.
- Practice common openers like "Tell me about yourself" and "Why do you want this role?"
- Align your answers with the company’s mission, culture, and the job description.

# STAR Method Example

Q: Tell me about a time you solved a difficult problem.

A: "At my previous job, we encountered X (Situation). My task was Y (Task). I did A, B, and C (Action). As a result, Z happened (Result)."

# Technical Interview Tips

- When answering system design questions, start with clarifying requirements.
- Break down complex problems into components before diving into code or architecture.
- Mention trade-offs when choosing tools (e.g., RAG vs. fine-tuning, SQL vs. NoSQL).

# Role-Specific Advice (AI Architect, Consulting)

- Emphasize cross-functional communication skills—how you translate business needs into technical solutions.
- Show a strong grasp of cloud infrastructure (especially Azure) and enterprise-grade AI deployment.
- Expect questions on ethical AI, data governance, and secure deployment practices.

# Consulting Soft Skills

- Show that you're client-facing, adaptable, and collaborative.
- Demonstrate proactive leadership: "I proposed X, which led to Y."
- Be prepared for scenario-based questions: "What would you do if a client disagreed with your solution?"

# Common Questions

- Tell me about yourself.
- What’s a recent technical challenge you overcame?
- How do you stay updated with the latest in AI/ML?
- Describe a time when you had to explain a complex concept to a non-technical stakeholder.

- Practice answers aloud to improve confidence and flow.
- Rest well before the interview. Mindset matters.
